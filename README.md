# Social Media Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a company's social media performance over a ten-year period. Data was acquired from the company and is separated into four CSV files corresponding to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Python, along with Matplotlib and Seaborn, was used for data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights to enhance the client's social media strategy and digital marketing efforts.
